# Multi-Level-Security-Access-System
A multi-level security system using LPC2148 that ensures high protection through three-tier authentication—RFID verification, password entry, and fingerprint recognition. It controls access via EEPROM-stored credentials and a DC motor lock, integrating peripherals like LCD, keypad, and UART for secure, real-time access control.
